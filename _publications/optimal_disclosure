title: "Optimal disclosure risk assessment"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/optimal_disclosure
authors: 'Federico Camerlenghi, Stefano Favaro, Zacharie Naulet, Francesca Panero'
excerpt: 'We propose a nonparametric estimator of disclosure risk and prove its minimax optimality. It's nice because we close an open problem in the literature (20+ years!) and the optimality proof is kind of crazy (credits to Zachary).'
