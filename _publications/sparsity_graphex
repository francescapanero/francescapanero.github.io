authors: 'Fran√ßois Caron, Francesca Panero and Judith Rousseau'
excerpt: 'This paper investigates properties of the class of graphs based on exchangeable point processes. We talk a lot about sparsity levels, degree distributions (power-law), positive clustering coefficients and central limit theorems. And we show how these properties hold for many many models.
