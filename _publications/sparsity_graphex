title: "On sparsity, power-law and clustering properties of graphex processes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/sparsity_graphex
authors: 'Fran√ßois Caron, Francesca Panero and Judith Rousseau'
excerpt: 'This paper investigates properties of the class of graphs based on exchangeable point processes. We talk a lot about sparsity levels, degree distributions (power-law), positive clustering coefficients and central limit theorems. And we show how these properties hold for many many models.'
