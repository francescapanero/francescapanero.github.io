Hello! I am Francesca Panero, Assistant Professor at the [Department of Statistics of the London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Francesca-Panero). In 2022 I obtained a PhD in Statistics from the [University of Oxford](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk).

In terms of research, so far I have worked on **Bayesian models** for a couple of applications: **complex networks** and **disclosure risk assessment** (privacy stuff). I have also published a work on **fair machine learning** (well, mostly generalised linear models).

I live in London, but you will very often find me in Rome.
