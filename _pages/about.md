About me
======

Hello! I am Francesca Panero, Assistant Professor of Statistics at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics). I hold a PhD in Statistics from the [University of Oxford](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk).

In terms of research, so far I have worked on **Bayesian models** for a couple of applications: **complex networks** and **disclosure risk assessment** (privacy stuff). I have also published a work on fair machine learning (well, mostly generalised linear models).
