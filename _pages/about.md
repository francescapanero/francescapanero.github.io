Hello! I am Francesca Panero, Assistant Professor (RTT) in Statistics at the Department of Methods and Models for Economics, Territory and Finance ([MEMOTEF](https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/en)) at Sapienza University, Rome, and a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Francesca-Panero) of the London School of Economics and Political Science where, up until May 2024, I was an Assistant Professor. At LSE, I am also affiliate of the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI) and the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/). 

In 2022 I obtained a PhD in Statistics from the [University of Oxford](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk).
Before the PhD, I spent quite some time (BSc and MSc) at the [Department of Mathematics of the University of Turin](https://dipmath.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) and at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org).

I live in Rome, but you might find me in London too! 

You can contact me at **francesca [dot] panero [at] uniroma1.it** or **f [dot] panero [at] lse.ac.uk**

## Projects

In terms of research, I mostly work on **Bayesian models** in the following directions: **complex networks**, **disclosure risk assessment** (privacy stuff) and **Gaussian process modelling**. I am also exploring **fair machine learning**. At the moment, I am working on the following projects:
* Bayesian nonparametric models for sparse networks, in particular networks embedded in a latent space or with dynamic communities. The theorethical framework of these is the graphex, which was introduced (under a different name) by [Caron and Fox (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/HTTPHandlers/Sigma/LoginHandler.ashx?code=zq2fS0&state=03f80ff8-db1e-450b-b8d3-c46ac579ddbaredirecturl%3Dhttpszazjzjacademiczwoupzwcomzjjrsssbzjarticlezyabstractzj79zj5zj1295zj7041107). I am working on these with [F. Caron](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/), [J. Rousseau](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/) and [X. Miscouridou](https://www.misxenia.com).
* Spatio-temporal Gaussian process models to predict food insecurity at country and regional level. This is joint work with [S. Ishida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahoko-ishida/?originalSubdomain=uk) and the UN World Food Programme Hunger Monitoring Unit. This project is supported by a [RISF](https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/research-and-innovation/research/apply-for-funding/lse-research-support-fund) grant by LSE.
* Fair machine learning, in particular models with a ridge penalty to enforce some fairness constraints and how to quantify the uncertainty of the estimators. I am currently working on this with [M. Scutari](https://www.bnlearn.com/about/) and [E. Wit](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/83636b7ab2950f852dbd345e9220c266/wit-ernst-jan-camiel).

On the educational side, I am part of the core team of [GENIAL](https://lse-dsi.github.io/genial/), a focus group at LSE that aims at understanding how students use GenAI tools for learning.

If you are interested in **doing a PhD with me**, please do get in touch specifying which of my areas of research would be of interest to you.

## News

Finally, where can you find me in the next few months?
* In June/July 2024, I will be speaking at the [ISBA Satellite workshop in Lugano](https://www.usi.ch/it/feeds/25999) and present a poster and a talk at the [ISBA World Meeting](https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home) in Venice.
* In July 2024, I will be speaking at the [Design and Analysis of Networked Experiments](https://vkstats.github.io/dane2024/) workshop at King's College London.
* In September 2024, I will present my work at the [BIRS](http://www.birs.ca) workshop "Frontiers of Bayesian Inference and Data Science" in Oaxaca, Mexico.
