Hello! I am Francesca Panero, Assistant Professor (RTT) in Statistics at the Department of Methods and Models for Economics, Territory and Finance ([MEMOTEF) at Sapienza University, Rome](https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/en), and a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Statistics of the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) where, up until May 2024, I was an Assistant Professor. At LSE, I am also affiliate of the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/).

In 2022 I obtained a PhD in Statistics from the [University of Oxford](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk).
Before the PhD, I spent quite some time (BSc and MSc) at the Department of Mathematics of the [University of Turin](https://dipmath.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) and at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org).

I live in Rome ü§å, but you might find me in London too üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è! 

You can contact me at **francesca [dot] panero [at] uniroma1.it** or **f [dot] panero [at] lse.ac.uk**

## News

- ü•≥ I have been elected as **[j-ISBA](https://j-isba.github.io) Chair Elect** for 2025-2026! This is extremely exciting and I am looking forward to start working with the other board members to make our Bayesian word an even more inclusive place where to foster collaborations and meet great people. Thanks for voting me!

- üá´üá∑ I will be giving a contributed talk about qunatifying uncertainty in fair ML models at [ICSDS 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/ims-icsds2024/) in December in Nice.

- üá¨üáß On January 9-10 I'll be in Lancaster at the [STOR-i](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/about-us/stor-i-cdt/) CDT annual workshop talking about Gaussian processes and food insecurity.
 
- üé§ I was recently a discussant at the **[LSE Public Lecture: "Data visualisation: alive visual words"](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Events/2024/11/202411201830/Data-visualisation-alive-visual-words?_gl=1*1cxa9xu*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjE3MjI3MDQuQ2p3S0NBandxZjIwQmhCd0Vpd0F0N2R0ZFpZOGxFcGVXc25LekZST1JaTS0xMGUxa3FUVXMybGlvSWY3NWlPUnozbThZNnBOWDVrcVdCb0NUQklRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*NTg1MjEwNjQzLjE3MTg2OTkwODI.*_ga*MTYwODM3MTA0LjE3MDI5ODI4MTc.*_ga_LWTEVFESYX*MTcyNDY1NDAyNy4xODUuMS4xNzI0NjU0NDE0LjU1LjAuMA..)**. You can read more about it in my [blog post]([https://francescapanero.github.io](https://francescapanero.github.io/posts/2024/12/data-visualisation/)) (I am writing something there! Incredible!) or watch the [YouTube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13aIeZdv5RI).

## Projects

In terms of research, I mostly work on **Bayesian models** in the following directions: **complex networks**, **disclosure risk assessment** (privacy stuff) and **Gaussian process modelling**. I am also exploring **fair machine learning**. At the moment, I am working on the following projects:
* Bayesian nonparametric models for sparse networks, in particular networks embedded in a latent space or with dynamic communities. The theorethical framework of these is the graphex, which was introduced (under a different name) by [Caron and Fox (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/HTTPHandlers/Sigma/LoginHandler.ashx?code=zq2fS0&state=03f80ff8-db1e-450b-b8d3-c46ac579ddbaredirecturl%3Dhttpszazjzjacademiczwoupzwcomzjjrsssbzjarticlezyabstractzj79zj5zj1295zj7041107). I am working on these with [F. Caron](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/), [J. Rousseau](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/) and [X. Miscouridou](https://www.misxenia.com).
* Spatio-temporal Gaussian process models to predict food insecurity at country and regional level. This is joint work with [S. Ishida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahoko-ishida/?originalSubdomain=uk) and the UN World Food Programme Hunger Monitoring Unit. This project is supported by a [RISF](https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/research-and-innovation/research/apply-for-funding/lse-research-support-fund) grant by LSE.
* Fair machine learning, in particular models with a ridge penalty to enforce some fairness constraints and how to quantify the uncertainty of the estimators. I am currently working on this with [M. Scutari](https://www.bnlearn.com/about/) and [E. Wit](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/83636b7ab2950f852dbd345e9220c266/wit-ernst-jan-camiel).

On the educational side, I am part of the core team of [GENIAL](https://lse-dsi.github.io/genial/), a focus group at LSE that aims at understanding how students use GenAI tools for learning.

If you are interested in **doing a PhD with me**, please do get in touch specifying which of my areas of research would be of interest to you.
