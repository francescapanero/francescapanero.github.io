Since 2020, I started working on ED&I topics. As part of the committe of [EquiStats](https://tylerkf.github.io/equistats/) (website not up to date), I have organised sessions on diverse hiring practice, fair machine learning and women in ML. In 2022 I worked with the [ED&I Office of the Mathematical, Physical and Life Science division at the University of Oxford](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/equality-and-diversity), doing research on diversity topics. At the Department of Statistics of LSE, I will organise the network of Women in Statistics.

Please, drop me a message if you have ideas for cool things to do!
