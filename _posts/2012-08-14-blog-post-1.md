I have been fantasising about having a blog for a long time (ok, well, one year at least).

The biggest challenge was that I was not able to have a dedicated page on my old website. Now that I have this shining new website - thank you so much [academicpages by Stuart Geiger](https://academicpages.github.io) - I have no excuse not to start rambling here. We'll see how that goes.

P.S. for anybody who would like to use this template for their website: your domain (in my case, francescapanero) needs to match your GitHub account name, otherwise the fancy html will not work. I have learnt this after two hours of painful search of a bug, and would love to save somebody else that time. Other than that, setting up the website forking the [original repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) is simple!
